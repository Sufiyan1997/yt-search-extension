    <text start="0.13" dur="3.646">- Tucked away in the picturesque little
village of Knaresborough in Yorkshire,</text>
    <text start="3.776" dur="2.064">is Mother Shipton&amp;#39;s Cave.</text>
    <text start="5.84" dur="5.02">And the publicity claims that it is &amp;quot;England&amp;#39;s
oldest still-surviving tourist attraction&amp;quot;.</text>
    <text start="10.86" dur="1.24">Good luck fact-checking that,</text>
    <text start="12.1" dur="1.46">but I can&amp;#39;t find anything else</text>
    <text start="13.56" dur="3.26">that&amp;#39;s been charging an
admission fee for nearly 400 years.</text>
    <text start="16.82" dur="2.59">To be fair, good luck fact-checking
anything in this story.</text>
    <text start="19.41" dur="2.39">It&amp;#39;s likely that there was a
woman called Mother Shipton</text>
    <text start="21.8" dur="3.17">who lived about 500 years
ago, but after that,</text>
    <text start="24.97" dur="2.85">actual certified references
are shaky at best.</text>
    <text start="27.82" dur="3.26">She&amp;#39;s said these days to have
been a witch and a prophet</text>
    <text start="31.08" dur="3.58">who lived in a cave with
a pool shaped like a skull</text>
    <text start="34.66" dur="2.11">that turned things to stone.</text>
    <text start="36.77" dur="4.75">- We all grow up in this area
hearing about Mother Shipton,</text>
    <text start="41.52" dur="2.023">and so we grew up with her prophecies.</text>
    <text start="44.41" dur="3.96">We&amp;#39;re talking about the year 1488.</text>
    <text start="48.37" dur="3.79">There was a young lady
called Agatha Sontheil,</text>
    <text start="52.16" dur="2.64">was cast out of the
town of Knaresborough</text>
    <text start="54.8" dur="4.21">at the age of 15 because
she was having a baby.</text>
    <text start="59.01" dur="2.31">So, she came to these woods</text>
    <text start="61.32" dur="4.14">and, in the cave, gave
birth to a baby girl</text>
    <text start="65.46" dur="2.15">called Ursula Sontheil.</text>
    <text start="67.61" dur="3.68">She was born, it is said,
with a hunched back,</text>
    <text start="71.29" dur="3.42">but she was also a
very, very clever young lady.</text>
    <text start="74.71" dur="2.18">At the age of five,</text>
    <text start="76.89" dur="4.18">she went to the medieval
equivalent of school.</text>
    <text start="81.07" dur="2.5">She left school at 15.</text>
    <text start="83.57" dur="3.91">At the age of 20, she got
married to a carpenter</text>
    <text start="87.48" dur="3.26">by the name of Tobias Shipton.</text>
    <text start="90.74" dur="5">But by this time, she was
having visions about the future</text>
    <text start="96.59" dur="3.92">and news of her prophecies
was starting to spread.</text>
    <text start="100.51" dur="2.52">There was a lot of superstition about her.</text>
    <text start="103.03" dur="3.233">She was already learning
to hate authority,</text>
    <text start="107.21" dur="2.6">and some people thought
she was a witch.</text>
    <text start="109.81" dur="2.98">There was a bridge at
the entrance to the park.</text>
    <text start="112.79" dur="2.277">Now, Mother Shipton said,</text>
    <text start="115.067" dur="4.54">&amp;quot;When the High Bridge in
Knaresborough has fallen thrice,</text>
    <text start="119.607" dur="2.883">&amp;quot;the end of the world is nigh.&amp;quot;</text>
    <text start="122.49" dur="4.68">Not to get you worried, it
has been down twice already.</text>
    <text start="127.17" dur="2.77">But there are more
roadworks across that bridge</text>
    <text start="129.94" dur="3.03">than anywhere else in this area</text>
    <text start="132.97" dur="3.6">and I can assure you it&amp;#39;s very solid.</text>
    <text start="136.57" dur="2.33">- We&amp;#39;ll never know which
of the many, many stories</text>
    <text start="138.9" dur="2.16">about Mother Shipton&amp;#39;s
life were actually true.</text>
    <text start="141.06" dur="1.59">She&amp;#39;s a folk legend.</text>
    <text start="142.65" dur="2.57">And unless the laws of physics have
changed in the last few centuries,</text>
    <text start="145.22" dur="1.94">she couldn&amp;#39;t actually see the future.</text>
    <text start="147.16" dur="2.83">But the pool that turns objects to stone?</text>
    <text start="149.99" dur="1.88">Well, that is real.</text>
    <text start="151.87" dur="2.26">And at some point a few centuries ago,</text>
    <text start="154.13" dur="3.14">some enterprising local decided
to start charging admission.</text>
    <text start="157.27" dur="3.79">- This park used to belong
to the Royal Family.</text>
    <text start="161.06" dur="6.55">It was bought by Sir Charles Slingsby
from King Charles I in 1630.</text>
    <text start="167.61" dur="2.97">Sir Charles was a canny Yorkshire man</text>
    <text start="170.58" dur="4.17">who decided a pretty penny
could be made from this place,</text>
    <text start="174.75" dur="2.77">hence guided tours
commenced here in that year.</text>
    <text start="177.52" dur="1.99">Not me, I have to add!</text>
    <text start="179.51" dur="4.12">Before he bought this, it
had a very, very bad press.</text>
    <text start="183.63" dur="2.15">People, being superstitious,</text>
    <text start="185.78" dur="4.35">would find animal skeletons,
leaves turning to stone,</text>
    <text start="190.13" dur="3.85">and they actually thought
people would turn to stone.</text>
    <text start="193.98" dur="3.38">He soon realised he was
onto a good thing here.</text>
    <text start="197.36" dur="7.21">The waters consist of iron, zinc,
magnesium, aluminium, calcium carbonate.</text>
    <text start="204.57" dur="5.44">There&amp;#39;s a stream which is underground,
and it comes to the surface</text>
    <text start="210.01" dur="2.79">just before you come down to this well.</text>
    <text start="212.8" dur="3.84">It comes to the surface,
it goes over the wellhead,</text>
    <text start="216.64" dur="2.83">and when it drops down,
it&amp;#39;ll turn anything to stone</text>
    <text start="219.47" dur="2.763">because of the various
chemicals it&amp;#39;s picked up.</text>
    <text start="223.1" dur="4.01">And it became
known as a health cure.</text>
    <text start="227.11" dur="4.22">People would bathe in the
water and drink the water.</text>
    <text start="231.33" dur="2.22">It it supposed to cure rheumatism.</text>
    <text start="233.55" dur="3.97">It&amp;#39;s not recommendable today
with modern health and safety(!)</text>
    <text start="237.52" dur="1.41">- This isn&amp;#39;t true petrification.</text>
    <text start="238.93" dur="2.86">The material isn&amp;#39;t being
replaced with stone.</text>
    <text start="241.79" dur="2.65">But at the risk of making
some chemists angry at me,</text>
    <text start="244.44" dur="1.44">I think it&amp;#39;s close enough.</text>
    <text start="245.88" dur="3.32">The water here is so rich in minerals,
carbonates and sulphates,</text>
    <text start="249.2" dur="2.88">that it acts like stalactites
forming in a cave</text>
    <text start="252.08" dur="2.45">or limescale building up
on your plumbing.</text>
    <text start="254.53" dur="2.8">The teddy bears, the hats,
the whatever&amp;#39;s in here,</text>
    <text start="257.33" dur="3.89">it&amp;#39;s steadily being coated in minerals
over and over and over again.</text>
    <text start="261.22" dur="2.82">And if it&amp;#39;s porous, it becomes
solid enough that,</text>
    <text start="264.04" dur="1.71">yeah, it turns to stone.</text>
    <text start="265.75" dur="1.65">Chemically, maybe not.</text>
    <text start="267.4" dur="2.27">Linguistically? Sure, I&amp;#39;ll take that.</text>
    <text start="269.67" dur="3.5">- Now, with regard to the
objects that you see up there,</text>
    <text start="273.17" dur="2.28">it&amp;#39;s got to be anything porous.</text>
    <text start="275.45" dur="4.13">The smaller the object is,
the shorter time it takes.</text>
    <text start="279.58" dur="2.9">A teddy would take about three months.</text>
    <text start="282.48" dur="4.43">Anything bigger would
take six months to a year.</text>
    <text start="286.91" dur="2.17">It does freeze in winter.</text>
    <text start="289.08" dur="4.73">Icicles come right down to the floor,
and it&amp;#39;s quite spectacular.</text>
    <text start="293.81" dur="2.623">It&amp;#39;s been flowing since the ice age.</text>
    <text start="297.411" dur="6.099">The other remarkable thing about the water
is it flows at the same rate all the time:</text>
    <text start="303.51" dur="5.03">700 gallons an hour.
It never varies, drought or flood.</text>
    <text start="308.54" dur="3.8">It&amp;#39;s again one of the wonders of the well:
it never dries up.</text>
    <text start="312.34" dur="2.11">- Mother Shipton&amp;#39;s Cave is
still a tourist attraction.</text>
    <text start="314.45" dur="2.528">They still charge money to do
the nice long walk through the park </text>
    <text start="316.978" dur="3.442">and then come and marvel at the pool
that turns things to stone.</text>
    <text start="320.42" dur="1.27">But before theme parks,</text>
    <text start="321.69" dur="1.9">before American roadside attractions,</text>
    <text start="323.59" dur="2">before seaside tourist traps,</text>
    <text start="325.59" dur="2.35">there was a cave, a good story,</text>
    <text start="327.94" dur="2.11">and someone who wanted to
make some money off it.</text>
    <text start="330.05" dur="2.683">And they still sell the
teddy bears in the gift shop.</text>
